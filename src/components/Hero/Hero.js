            Not a flat vector graphic in sight â€“ this pack has been meticulously
            crafted in shiny 3D beauty.

          <h2>High definition</h2>
          <p>
            Each icon has been rendered at 2048px, ludicrously large for an icon
            but it's just nice to see the details sometimes.

          <h2>Over 100 icons included</h2>
          <p>
            Included in this pack are over 100 icons of the most commonly used
            apps and utilities.
